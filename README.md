# 10 bit single-cycle CPU
Read the ISA for more information.
Here I have included a logisim file with my fully functional design for Datapath. This was a project for my CSE332 course.

If the file does not work in logisim after downloading it then just copy paste the source code in notepad and save the file with a .circ extension at the end. It should work then.
Have fun.
