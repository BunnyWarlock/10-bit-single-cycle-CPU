# 10 bit single-cycle CPU
Read the ISA for more information.
Here I have included a logisim file with my fully functional design for Datapath. This was a project for my CSE332 course.

If the file does not work in logisim after downloading it then just copy paste the source code in notepad and save the file with a .circ extension at the end. It should work then.
Have fun.

The assembler will take the code from input.txt or any other file you mention and output the hex code needed to be put in the logisim file for the program to run.
